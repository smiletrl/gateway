# Simple Payment Gateway App

This app is supposed to be built with Go, Python, Rust. It provides rest API endpoint development practices I have taken.

The overall idea is to separate api request to different layers, making code maintainable, and easy for test.

Here're the frameworks used in this repo:

- [Go Eacho](https://github.com/labstack/echo)
- [Python FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi)
