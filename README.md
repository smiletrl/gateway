# Simple Payment Gateway App

It provides rest API endpoint development practices I have taken for Go, Python and Rust.

The overall idea is to separate api request to different layers, making code maintainable, and easy for test.

Each language has a `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` available to deploy the app as a docker container.
